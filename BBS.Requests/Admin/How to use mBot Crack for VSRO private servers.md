# How to use mBot Crack for VSRO private servers
 
mBot is a popular bot for Silkroad Online, a MMORPG game based on the ancient Silk Road. mBot allows players to automate various tasks such as hunting, picking up items, buffing, and more. However, mBot is not free and requires a monthly subscription to use.

Fortunately, there is a way to use mBot for free on VSRO based private servers, which are unofficial servers that run on modified versions of the game. This is possible thanks to a crack developed by ColdFever^NoEx and released on elitepvpers.com[^1^], a forum for online gaming enthusiasts. The crack bypasses the authentication process of mBot and lets you use it without paying.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use mBot Crack for VSRO private servers. Please note that this crack only works for VSRO version 1.12b, which is the current version as of April 2023. Also, be aware that using a cracked software may violate the terms of service of the game and expose you to security risks.
 
## Step 1: Download mBot and mBot Crack
 
The first step is to download mBot and mBot Crack from the links provided below. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files.
 
- [mBot\_vSRO110\_1.12b.zip](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/sro-pserver-guides-releases/1727322-release-mbot-crack-vsro-current-version-1-12b.html) (3.06 MB) - This is the original mBot file for VSRO 110.
- [mBotCrack.rar](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/sro-pserver-guides-releases/1727322-release-mbot-crack-vsro-current-version-1-12b.html) (1.48 MB) - This is the crack file that contains two files: loader and dll.
- [mBotCrack\_patch.rar](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/sro-pserver-guides-releases/1727322-release-mbot-crack-vsro-current-version-1-12b.html) (405.8 KB) - This is a patch file that fixes the connection issue of the crack.

After downloading the files, extract them in a folder of your choice. You should have something like this:

## Step 2: Start mBot Loader and log in
 
The next step is to start mBot Loader.exe and wait until mBot shows up. You will see a window like this:
 ![mbot loader](https://i.imgur.com/0uY6w0y.png) 
Here, you need to set your silkroad folder by clicking on the Browse button and selecting the folder where your game client is installed. For example, C:\Program Files (x86)\Silkroad.
 
Then, you need to log in with any username and password. It doesn't matter what you enter, as long as they are not empty. The crack will bypass the authentication process and let you use mBot for free.
 
After entering your credentials, click on the Login button and wait until the message "Successfully logged in" appears at the bottom of the window.
 
## Step 3: Configure the bot and enjoy
 
The final step is to configure the bot as usual and enjoy its features. You can find anything you need on the mBot forum[^1^], under the "Guides & FAQ" section. There are tutorials on how to set up your skills, items, pick filter, loop script, and more.
 
To start the bot, click on the Start button at the top of the window. You will see a new window like this:
