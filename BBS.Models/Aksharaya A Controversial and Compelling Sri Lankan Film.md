# Aksharaya: A Controversial and Compelling Sri Lankan Film
 
Aksharaya, also known as A Letter of Fire, is a 2005 Sri Lankan film directed by Asoka Handagama. The film explores the themes of incest, murder, corruption and power in a dysfunctional family of a magistrate, a retired judge and their 12-year-old son. The film was banned in Sri Lanka by the government of Mahinda Rajapakse, who accused the director of tarnishing the image of the country and its judiciary. The film also faced protests and threats from religious groups and nationalists who deemed it immoral and anti-Sinhalese.

The film begins with a shocking scene of the son killing a prostitute in an abandoned building, after mistaking her for a mugger who attacked him earlier. He runs back to his home, where his parents decide to hide him from the authorities and cover up the crime. The film then reveals the twisted relationship between the son and his mother, who engages in sexual acts with him while his father is unaware. The father, meanwhile, is a corrupt magistrate who takes bribes and abuses his power. He also has an affair with his housemaid, who becomes pregnant with his child. The film depicts the moral decay and hypocrisy of the upper-class society in Sri Lanka, as well as the violence and oppression that pervades the country.
 
The film was praised by critics and audiences who appreciated its bold and daring approach to tackle taboo subjects and expose social issues. The film also won several awards at international film festivals, such as the Tokyo International Film Festival and the Kerala International Film Festival. The film was also screened at the Rotterdam International Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, where it received positive reviews. The film was hailed as a masterpiece of Sri Lankan cinema and a landmark work of Asian cinema.
 
Aksharaya is a film that challenges the viewer to confront their own prejudices and assumptions about morality, sexuality and justice. It is a film that provokes debate and discussion about the complex realities of Sri Lanka and its people. It is a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by anyone who appreciates cinema as an art form and a medium of expression.
  
The film also uses symbolism and metaphors to convey its message and create an impact on the viewer. For example, the fire that burns throughout the film represents the passion, anger and destruction that consumes the characters and their society. The letter that the son writes to his mother confessing his love and guilt is a symbol of his innocence and vulnerability, as well as his desire to escape from his reality. The museum where the father works as a guard is a symbol of the past and the history that haunts the present. The film also uses imagery and sound to create a contrast between the beauty and ugliness of Sri Lanka, such as the scenic landscapes and the urban chaos, the classical music and the gunshots, the religious rituals and the sexual acts.
 
The film also challenges the conventional norms and expectations of cinema and storytelling. The film does not follow a linear narrative structure, but rather jumps back and forth in time and space, creating confusion and suspense for the viewer. The film also does not provide any clear answers or resolutions for the conflicts and dilemmas that it raises, but rather leaves them open for interpretation and debate. The film also breaks the fourth wall by addressing the viewer directly at some points, such as when the son looks at the camera and says "I love you" to his mother, or when the father says "This is not a film" at the end of the film.
 
Aksharaya is a film that defies categorization and classification. It is a film that transcends genres and boundaries. It is a film that challenges and confronts its viewer with its raw and unflinching portrayal of human nature and society. It is a film that deserves to be recognized and respected as a work of art and a work of courage.
